# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* DOM is an application programming interface that defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. The good about DOM is that developers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements/content with it. It also provides standard programming language that can be used in a wide variety of environments and applications (programming language), which really makes sense to me.

* By using Chrome Dev Tools, I can peak through the source code of wordpress.com and use some of them as an inspiration to my webpage.

* I found the Chrome Web Tools to be really fun and helpful because I can live edit the page and see the immediate results. This saved me a lot of time when I was editing my webpage.

* The concept of DOM was solidified to me by the help of Chrome Dev Tools. When I was experimenting with the Dev Tools, I understood the concept of DOM better and faster.

* To help me understand DOM and Dev Tools better, I used some websites such as wikipedia, stackoverflow, and w3schools.

* I am pretty confident with each of the learning competencies. I was able to do all of them correctly by using the resources that were given and also the ones that I found on my own. The part of the challenge that I enjoyed was definitely the one where I had to use Chrome Dev Tools.
