* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Responsive web design is the practice of building a website that is suitable to work on every device and every screen size. I think its a really good practice to do responsive web design because it helped people to browse the web on their phones, tablets, or any other devices just as easily as they do on the desktop computers.  

* Smartphones and tablets have changed web design by changing the landscape of web browsers. Nowadays, every smartphones/tablets has a web browser installed on it, therefore it is important to use responsive web design to deliver the optimal experiences for the users based on the screen size and context. New technology such as the wearable devices would definitely change the web design in the future. Developers have to come up with new ideas in order to make websites accessible for the users of the new interfaces.

* Visually impaired people can use the web by using screen readers, which is a program that reads aloud everything that appears on the browsers. We should definitely have accessibility features for them because it is the right thing to do to help them have access to our website. 

* The concepts of responsive web design definitely resonated with me as I was learning about the web design. Before, I always thought that developers create a different version of the website for each individual devices. 

* I found a couple of resources that helped me understand the topic of responsive design better. They are https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIz02qY5BRA and http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design
