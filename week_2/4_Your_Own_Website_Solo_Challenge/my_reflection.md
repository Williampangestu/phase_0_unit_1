My Website url: http://williampangestu.github.io/unit1_projects/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I learnt that user experience design is a way that connects a system (webiste, web application, software, etc.) with the customers/users. In order to create a solid user experience for users, the website definitely need to have a good performace. Also, it is important to make the system stand out and attract user's attention.

* It was fun working on the process of designing and wireframing my website. It definitely saved me lots of time because what I need to do is just following my plan instead of experimenting on how my website is going to look.

* My process of making my website is first thinking about the purpose and goal of my website. After that, I wireframe it using wireframing tools online. After I know how my website is going to look like, I start making and designing it. Since I made such a simple website, I did not encounter any problem during the process.

* I would definitely try to add a responsive design to my website. Also I am planning to try to use semantic elements better.

* I tried to add responsive design for my website. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessfull on doing it. Thus, I am planning to ask and do some pair programming with one of the people from my accountibility group in order to fix my problems.

* I found a couple of resources that helped me on designing my website. They are http://mediaqueri.es/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIz02qY5BRA.
