# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

* Since I am currently on my last semester of my undergraduate studies, the biggest time management challenge that I have during phase 0 is learning how to manage my time between school and DBC. So far, I don't think I have done a good job on managing my time for both of them. 

* In order to combat that, every week I am planning to make a list of things that I need to work on. Then, I will work through the list, starting from the most important one to the least important. Before, I always do the easiest task first and left the hardest task at the end. I also want to try to give myself less time to complete the assignments in order to finish them early and spend less time screwing around.

* I will definitely try the Pomodoro technique because I think it is a good idea to have a break for only 5 minutes after concentrating our mind for a long time. I usually do not limit my break, which is a bad practice because I am easily get distracted to do other things during my break time.

* My overall plan for phase 0 is to have a very good understanding of all the concepts and materials. Also, since we are going to do pair programming for most of our time in DBC, I am planning to practice pair programming as much as I can during phase 0 in order to be good at it.
