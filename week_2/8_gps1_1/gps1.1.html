      <ol>
        <li>Pair programming is when two programmers sit side-by-side. One is assigned the "navigator" and the other the "driver. It's important to define these roles and switch midway through sessions.</li>
        <li>The driver's goal is to work on the tactical challanges of creating rigorous, syntactically correct code without worrying about the big picture and it gives the navigator the opportunity to consider strategic issues without being distracted by the details of coding</li>
        <li>Communication is key. It's imporant to be specific and very detailed in your language. Also make use of identifing code by line #</li>
        <li>Feedback is also very important. It's crucial to communicate to your partner what you felt, and how your partner could help make for a more effective pairing session</li>
