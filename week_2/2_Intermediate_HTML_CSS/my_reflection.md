# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* I think web standards is important to set best practices for building and designing websites. By following the web standards, the development will be simplied since it is easier for a developer to understand other people's code. Moreover, it will also enable developers to create websites that works reasonably well across all browsers. Sometimes, one browser would implement features that other browser do not have, which led to websites that do not work properly in both browsers. 

* The standard structure for HTML5 makes a total sense to me since it is important for both the users and developers. It helps them understand what's happening and where is it on the page easier.

* I like the new HTML5 elements because it clearly describes its meaning, which makes it easier for the reader to understand the content of the code. For example, 'nav' element represents a section of page that contains navigation links to other pages or parts within the page. In addition, 'footer' is used to define the footer of the page. 

* In the beginning there was no standardisation on how styles worked, each browser have its own default stylesheet that it uses to make unstyled websites appear more legible. This caused problems for developers because they can't make their websites look the same in every browser. Thus, reset.css is necessary to ensure that each web browser have all its styles reset to null. By doing this, developers can avoid cross-browser differences and inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins, headings' font size, etc. as much as possible. Then, after the consistent base is set up using reset.css, developers can start re-styling their document. 

* I have always used Google Chrome as my main browser and when I tried to open my website in Mozilla Firefox and Safari, I noticed that it looks slighly different. I think this inconsistency is bad and it also creates problem for the users and developers. Fortunately, this problem can be solved using reset.css. 

* Other than the given resources, I used the following websites to help me understand the concept of HTML semantic elements and reset.css better:
