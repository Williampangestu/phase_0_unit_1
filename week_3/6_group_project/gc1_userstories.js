//We want to create two variables with multiple number values.
//We want to call the first variable oddLengthArray, and the second variable evenLengthArray.
//We want the oddLengthArray to have seven values.
//We want the evenLengthArray to have eight values.
//We want to create a function called 'sum' that will calculate the Sum, of the values, of each of our variables.
//We want to create a function called 'mean' to calculate the Mean, of the values, of each of our of our variables.
//We want to create a function called 'median' to calculate the Median, of the values, of each of our of our variables.

//We want the sum, of values, of the oddLengthArray variable to equal 27
//We want the sum, of values, of the evenLengthArray variable to equal 43
//We want the mean, of values, of oddLengthArray variable to equal 3.857142857142857
//We want the mean, of values, of evenLengthArray variable to equal 5.375
//We want the median, of values, of oddLengthArray variable to equal 4
//We want the median, of values, of evenLengthArray variable to equal 5.5
