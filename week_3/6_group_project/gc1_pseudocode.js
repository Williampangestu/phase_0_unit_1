// TO CALCULATE THE SUM:
// create a function called sum that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, create a variable called 'answer' and set it equal to 0
// check / go through all elements inside the array using for loops
// add each element in the array to 'answer' and put the result of that addition back to 'answer', closed the for loop
// return 'answer' and exit the function

// TO CALCULATE THE MEAN:
// create a function called mean that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, create a variable called 'answer' and set it equal to 0
// check / go through all elements inside the array using for loops
// add each element in the array to 'answer' and put the result of that addition back to 'answer', closed the for loop
// return 'answer' divided by the length of the array and exit the function

// TO CALCULATE THE MEDIAN:
// create a function called median that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, sort the array in ascending order using .sort method
// create a variable called 'middleNum' and set it equal to the result of calling Math.floor method on (length of the array divided by 2)
// use if and else statement
// if the length of the array is even number
// access the 'middleNum' of the array and the 'middleNum-1' of the array, add them together and divide it by 2. Return the result of this.
// else
// access the 'middleNum' of the array and return it
// exit the function
