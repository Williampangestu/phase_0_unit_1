// TO CALCULATE THE SUM:
// create a function called sum that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, create a variable called 'answer' and set it equal to 0
// check / go through all elements inside the array using for loops
// add each element in the array to 'answer' and put the result of that addition back to 'answer', closed the for loop
// return 'answer' and exit the function

// TO CALCULATE THE MEAN:
// create a function called mean that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, create a variable called 'answer' and set it equal to 0
// check / go through all elements inside the array using for loops
// add each element in the array to 'answer' and put the result of that addition back to 'answer', closed the for loop
// return 'answer' divided by the length of the array and exit the function

// TO CALCULATE THE MEDIAN:
// create a function called median that take an array as a parameter/argument
// inside the function, sort the array in ascending order using .sort method
// create a variable called 'middleNum' and set it equal to the result of calling Math.floor method on (length of the array divided by 2)
// use if and else statement
// if the length of the array is even number
// access the 'middleNum' of the array and the 'middleNum-1' of the array, add them together and divide it by 2. Return the result of this.
// else
// access the 'middleNum' of the array and return it
// exit the function



// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
// 
// What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
// My strategy was writing the actual code after I'm done pseudocoding in order to make sure that it is right.
//
// What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
// What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
// I did not have any trouble on the concept of pseudocoding. However, I have some questions about how to make a
// good and understable pseudocode. I used https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs/programming/good-practices/p/pseudo-code
// to help me write a better pseudocode.
//
// Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
// I learn how to make a better and easy to understand pseudocode.
//
// How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
// I am quite confident with each of them. I think I did all of them right.
//
// Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
// writing the pseudocode.
//
// Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
// None.
//
// What was this experience like?
// For me, this is a really good experience on understanding the importance of teamwork. We would not be able to finish this
// assignment without each other. Every person has his own jobs and each of us is dependable to each other. 
//
// Was your group successful in passing the tests?
// Yes, we have successfully made the code that works and passed all the tests.
//
// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
// I learn that we have to do all this step by step. Without the user stories completed, we would not be able to move
// to pseudocoding and so on.s
