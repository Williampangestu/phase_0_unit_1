## Release 5: Reflection
* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face? What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I was having trouble pushing my files to my remote repository using the terminal. In order to help me with this, I asked for help from one of DBC students called Puru Dahal and I also use this resources http://gitimmersion.com/. 

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
I was having trouble grasping the concept of undoing changes in Git.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
I learn how to setup shortcut for some of the Git commands and also how to tag commits.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I think I am OK with the learning competencies, I still have to learn and do a lot more in order to have a fully understanding about Git. However, right now I am pretty confident on doing some simple Git command using the terminal such as add, commit, push, pull, merge, etc.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I enjoyed the challange of using Git through the terminal instead of the app. It gives me a much better understanding about Git.
