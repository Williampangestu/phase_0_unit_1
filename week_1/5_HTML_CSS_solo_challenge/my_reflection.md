## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

* During the challenge, I had a few questions in mind about how to position image and text inside the div correctly. Finally, I was able to find the answers to my questions by looking through some websites.

* I was having trouble understanding the concept of relative and absolute positioning. 

* I definitely learnt how to use relative and absolute positioning to position image inside div and also to put a caption on my picture. The other thing that I learnt is that we can actually use class and id together on the same element. For instance, we can put "<div class="Friends" id="Bestfriend"></div>".

* I am pretty confident with each of the learning competencies for this challenge, I think I successfully completed all of the challenges.

* The part of the challenge that I enjoy is actually when I was writing the code for my webpage and seeing the results.

* The part of the challenge that I found tedious is when I wanted to see the results after I changed the code. I need to first commit the changes that I made, then push it to my GitHub account. After that, I have to refresh the webpage to see the results. Sometimes, it's not showing the results immediately so I have to wait for a couple of minutes. I think it would be nice and more efficient if I can see the immediate results right after I change the code.
