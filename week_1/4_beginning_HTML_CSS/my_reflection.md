## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


* It makes sense to me that HTML can be considered as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. 

* The good thing about HTML is that it is really important in the process of making a webpage. Without it, I think it would be hard to make and structure a webpage. I can't really think of a bad thing about HTML except that it has to use CSS in order to syle the webpage.

* By working on this challenge, it solidified the concept of HTML and CSS for me. I was able to use HTML to structure my webpage and use CSS to describe the appearance and formatting of my webpage.

* Other than the resources that were provided, I used Codeacademy.com to help me have better understanding of the HTML and CSS concept.
