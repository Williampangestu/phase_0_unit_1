Hello Everyone,

I am a little bit late to do this introduction because I was busy with my school projects and exam last week. So, I had to ask for 1 day extension to finish all the assignments for week 1. 

My name is William Putra Pangestu. I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Indonesia, which is a country in Southeast Asia. I came to the US 5 years ago to pursue my dream of becoming an engineer. I currently live in Los Angeles, CA with my sister, my brother in law, and my niece and nephew. Right now, I am finishing my last semester as a mechanical engineering student at California State University Northridge.

During my undergraduate studies, I have done some programming using Excel VBA, Matlab, and LabView. My first programming class, which was in VBA and Matlab was like turning on the light bulb for me. When it comes to programming assignments, I actually enjoy the challenge of writing and making the code works. Because of that, I have developed a strong interest on programming and I was thinking of getting a minor on computer science. Then, when I was researching about it, I read an article about Dev Bootcamp on the Internet, which really caught my attention. After doing some research about DBC, I decided to throw away my initial plan of getting a minor in computer science. I would rather spend my money on 3 months of hands-on educational program than having to take 2 more semesters where I might only learn the theoretical knowledge of programming. 

I am really excited to go DBC Chicago because it will be a new experience for me. However, I am planning to move back and find a job in California (either San Francisco or Los Angeles) after DBC because I want to be close with my sister and her family. 

My favorite websites are:
Yahoo.com - I always read the latest world news on this website. I like it because it combines all types of news such as technology, sports, autos, etc. so that I don't have to search them by category.
Quirky.com - This website act as an alternative to crowd-funding sites such as kickstarter. It allows for invention idea suggestions by their users to be viewed and voted upon the rest of the invention "Community." If Quirky is able to generate enough retailer interest, they bring the product to market in partnership with the original inventor. I like this website because we can actually buy the innovative products that we like and it also gives me some inspiration to build something unique by looking at other people's works.
Goal.com - I like to watch and play soccer so I use this websites to read the latest news and videos about soccer games and players.

I have a kinesthetic learning style, I learn best through hands on activities such as projects rather than reading books or listening to a lecture. I am also a concrete sequential thinker so that I like to organize information in a linear, step by step manner. I also like to plan my work and work my plan when I was given tasks to do.

These are the links to my reflection file, my webpage, and my wireframe page:
