Blog url: http://williampangestu.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

Before this, I have never wrote a blog so this is my first time making and writing a blog. I have never done it because I don't feel like people would be interested on my thoughts. So, most of the time I keep my feelings and thoughts to myself. However, after I did it, it kinda feels good and I actually enjoy it because I can express my feelings and thoughts about certain things. Moreover, I also found it helpful to my learning because I can sort of reflect on what I learn in my blog.
