* 2 new things that I learn about the web are DNS and the difference between websites and web applications. Before, I didn't know anything about DNS, which stands for Domain Name systems. But right now, I know that DNS is basically a phone book of the internet. It keep a record of the domain names and IP addresses of all of the other computers on the internet. It is important because when you want to visit a website, your computer needs to get the website's IP address from the DNS server in order to ask for the webpage. The second thing that I learn is the difference between websites and web applications. I did not know that there is such thing as web applications. I always thought that they are all the same and called websites. Website is a single page site where no programming language and database are required. On the other hand, web application rely on people to interact with it. It also uses databases and programming language such as Ruby, Python, PHP, etc., which makes it dynamic and ever-changing.

* The important thing to remember when setting up HTML site is that we should always save our page/file on the GitHub app and then push it to GitHub.com in order to view it.

* When I saw my web page live, I feel accomplished and proud of myself. Ever since I learnt web development programming, this is the first time I actually created something on my own.  

* When I created HTML file and saved it on my GitHub app, it solidified the practical distinctions between Git and the other version control softwares. I completely understand the benefit of using Git when compared to other version controls. Other VCS think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time while Git records the entire contents of each file in every commit.

* The resources explains the concepts of we basics really clearly. Thus, I did not use any other resources.
