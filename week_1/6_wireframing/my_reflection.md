## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

* After doing this challenge, I learnt that design thinking is very important in order to achieve extraordinary results. I also learnt that we can have different approach for design thinking, they were tailored to the specialities of the designers and the needs of the users/clients. However, the core of the process stays the same. There is a visible pattern that we all use to design interfaces in different environments.

* I like the process of planning and wireframing before I build my website. Eventhough it is a little bit time consuming rather than just jump onto the problem and writing the code, the better results were achieved by doing wireframing first. Wireframing really helps me a lot because it allows me to plan the layout of my website without being distracted by colors and typeface choices.

* During the challenge, I did not really have any questions or having trouble with any concepts. All the concepts of design thinking and wireframing are explained clearly through the articles and resources that were given to me.

* I definitely learn a new skill called wireframing. I know how to use it and I will always use it before I make my own website. I think it is a very useful and important skill to use in order to make a webpage.

* I am pretty confident with the learning competencies for this challenge. I think I understand the concept of design thinking and wireframing cleary and I know how to use and apply them.

* The part of the challenge that I enjoyed is the one where we have to do reverse engineering for some websites. By doing so, I was able to get an overview and visual understanding of how other designers are handling their wireframing process. And more importantly, I can use it as an inspiration for my own website.

* There is no part of the challenge that I found tedious.
