## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I had a problem when I wanted to install git on my macbook. It says that I could not install it because the application was not downloaded from Mac App store or identified developers. After researching about it on the internet, I found that I just have to change my security and privacy settings to allow me to install git on my computer.

* Git is one of many type of Version Control System (VCS). It is a software/tool in your computer that manage and keep track of the changes in your work. For example, let say you work on the excel worksheet for your project. Everyday, you change or add stuff on it until it's done. Then, after you check through your work, you realized that there some mistakes and you want to go back to what you did 2 days ago. Git makes this really easy for you, you can go back to the earlier version of your work (before you make the mistake) and work from there. 
* On the other hand, GitHub is a web-based hosting service that provides remote access to your Git repositories. It is essentially an online place to host and share your Git works/projects with other people. Anyone can see your work and offer suggestions or improvements.
 
* Version control is a tool that stores a modification history of all of your code. Every modification/change made to the file is tracked, along with who made the change, why and when they made it, etc. Thus, when you mess up, you can easily go back to a previous working versions and reverse the changes. Moreover, Github helps people work together on a project over the internet by merging their changes into the same source repository. Without Github, people need to have their computer on and connect to a network at the same time in order to work together. 

* Version control allows developers to keep track of the changes that are made on their code files. So if they found some mistakes in the code, they can go back and fix things that went wrong. It also helps developers working together as a team on the same files/projects. Instead of sending files back and forth between team members, they can work on different parts of the file at the same time without overwriting each other's work. All of this make sense to me because by using version control, it will help developers to work faster and more efficient as an individual or as a team, which resulted in increased productivity.
