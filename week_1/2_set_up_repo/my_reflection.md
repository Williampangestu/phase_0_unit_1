## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Repository in GitHub is like an online directory for your files. In order to create a new repository, you have to log in to your Github account and click a green button on the right bottom page called "new repository". Then, you have to fill out the repository name, description, and you also have to make it public so that people can see your repository. After you are done, click green button on the bottom of the page called "create repository". Right now, you have successfully created a remote repository on the Github. However, in order for you to be able to add or edit files, you have to make a local repository on your computer. This is when the GitHub app comes into place. You have to open the Github app on your computer and log in using the same email address and password that you use for Github.com. After that, you will see your Github username on the left side bar of the app. When you click on it, it will show your repository on Github.com. Pick whichever repository you want to copy to your computer and click the button that says "clone to computer". After this, you will have access to that particular repository, which you can add or edit the files inside it. 
 
* Open source means that it is openly free for public to have access to the source code of the program. In other words, people will not only be able to use the program, they can also modify the program itself. 
 
* I think open source software can definitely be beneficial to the community. Since the world of programming is always changing and moving with infinite possibilities, people can contribute by improving upon the software and share the changes to the community. This makes the process of improving the software and eliminating errors/bugs happens at a faster rate. Not to mention that working on open source software will also allow programmer to build important and powerful collaboration skills when working towards a common goal. 
 
* Licenses is important for open source software because it lets other people to contribute to your project while prevent them from stealing your work. 
 
* The instructions on how to make an online repository on GitHub.com and clone it to my own computer help me to really understand the concept of Git and Github. Before this, I always thought of open source only as softwares that people can download freely. I didn't know that we can actually modify the software itself. 
 
* I think the resources that Dev Bootcamp provides are great to help me understand the concept of open source, the importance of licensing, how to make a repository on GitHub.com and how to copy it to my own computer. Therefore, I didn't use any other resources.
